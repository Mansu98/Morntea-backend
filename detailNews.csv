The interest rates on savings have not changed for Rastriya Banijya Bank. The bank will give annual interest payments in the range of 3-5% on savings, which is also the interest rates range for Nepal Credit and Commerce Bank, with the most savings products generating interest payments in the upper limit of that range. Fixed deposits will yield 5.5-7.1% for individuals and 5-6.5% for institutions. Thus, this hasn't changed from last month either.
Individual fixed depositors will yield in the range of 7-8%, just like in the previous month. In contrast, institutions will yield 7.5-8%, compared to 6.-8% in the previous month.
Similarly, the normal savings account will only yield 2.5% at Standard Chartered Bank. This figure was even lower last month, i.e. at 2%. Individual fixed depositors will yield in the range of 4.5-7%, compared to last month's range of 4.5-6%. The base rate of the commercial bank as of Chaitra last year is 5.33%.
NMB Bank Limited will give interest payment in the range of 3.6-5.6% p.a in Ashad. This is an increment, given that the range was 2-4% in the previous month. Individuals will get interest payments in the range of 6.5-7.8 p.a. on fixed deposits, compared to Jestha's rate of 5-7%. By now, it is apparent that banks have started to raise their interest rates, an indicator that they are achieving a greater balance in liquidity scenario compared to the worst days of the pandemic.
Machhapuchchhre Bank Limited will now pay 3.1-4% on savings compared to Jestha's rate range of 2-4%. Most savings schemes will yield the lower limit of the range, i.e. 3.1%. Individual fixed depositors will yield 7.51%, compared to last month's range of 7%. The industry giant Nabil Bank itself has increased its interest rate profile. Savings schemes will now yield 2.51-4.51%. This range was 1.51-3.51% for Jestha.
This article performed data sampling on a randomly selected list of commercial banks. The individual interest rate updates can be found on the company profile of each commercial bank on our portal."

With this, amateur and experienced investors alike have witnessed yet another humongous feat in the bull market that has not shown signs of slowing down as of now.
NEPSE was trading at around 100 index levels before the start of the year 2000. In a short span of 20 years, the index has had a gain of over 1,250%. This is an extraordinary gain no matter which stock exchange or investment instrument one compares it against. As of writing, the index is at 3,038.09.
Note that the index had briefly surpassed the 3,000 level last week itself, but it was shortly after the market-open. Furthermore, the index had immediately lost in a steep decline. 
While writing this, CDS and Clearing Limited reports a total of 35,46,758 Demat account holders on its official website. These are investors who contribute to the nation's development by contributing the much-needed capital to businesses that need it. Daily turnover of over Rs. 15 Arba does not excite investors anymore. Over two dozen companies hit the 10% positive circuit breakers on a normal day in this bull market.

Sharesansa'rs Personal Message: Naturally, stock markets create highs and lows, that is not what this article is about. This article is about looking back and reminiscing the good things that have happened in our capital market, from queuing in long lines to apply for an IPO to a completely online system. Changes indeed have happened, from trading stocks on the floor with ticker screen updated manually to instantaneous TMS portal, and from a handful of scrips to 35,700,374 shares traded on a single day.
Sharesansar commends all veteran investors who have witnessed the highs and lows of the country's capital market. With the investors, the regulatory board, the exchange, stockbroker companies, and all concerned parties involved, Sharesansar has also evolved and adapted with time.
Like all phases, the bullish phase may not last forever, but it seems that the enthusiasm of investors certainly will. Sharesansar celebrates and congratulates all who volunteer to invest their wealth for the betterment of the overall economy while making peace with the associated risks of the investment world.
Sharesansar, updating your financial world."
